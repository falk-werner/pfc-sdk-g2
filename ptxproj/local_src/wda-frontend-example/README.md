# WDA Frontend Example

This project contains a brief example how to access WDA frontend via C++, C, Python 3.

While C++ can nativly access WDA via `libparamcom`, other languages need a wrapper. This is done by [libwda_proxy](libwda_proxy). Make sure Python 3 is installed on your device to make python example work.

There is a [pre-relase](link-goes-here) providing IPKs based on PFC Firmware 23.
